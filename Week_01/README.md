| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/) | Use an extra space, an ArrayList, to store the index of element in the first iteration. Then copy them to the array. | Two pointers: slow-runner is used to pin the element to be replaced, while fast-runner skips duplicate and find next non-duplicated element. | **Easy** |
| [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/) | Rotate all the elements of the array in k steps by rotating the elements by 1 unit in each step | 1. Reverse original array,  2. Reverse first `k` elements. 3. Reverse last `n-k` element | Easy     |
| [283. Move Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/) | Count the number of zeros. Use an extra array to copy all non-zero elements in order. Append zeros to the end of new array. | Two pointers: zeros tracking the index of first zero and nonZeros tracking the index of first non-zero. Swap zeros and nonZeros. | Easy     |
| [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/) | Recursion with formula: {`list1[0]+mergeTwoLists(list1[1:],list2), list1[0]<list2[0]`   `list2[0]+mergeTwoLists(list1,list2[1:]), otherwise`} | Iterate two lists in parallel, always select the smaller one append to the result list. Watch out for unequal length of two lists. Copy the remaining to the result list. | Easy     |
| [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/) |                                                              |                                                              | Easy     |
| [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)         | Loop through each element x*x* and find if there is another value that equals to target - x. | `One-pass HashMap`. While we iterate and inserting elements into the table, we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the table. If it exists, we have found a solution and return immediately. | Easy     |
| [66. Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)      |                                                              | Identify the rightmost digit which is not equal to nine and increase that digit by one. If it's equal to nine, calculate the carry and sum, and bring the carry forward along. | Easy     |
| [641. Design Circular Deque](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-deque/) |                                                              |                                                              | Medium   |
| [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) |                                                              |                                                              | Hard     |
